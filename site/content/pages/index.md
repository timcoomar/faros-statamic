  At Faros, we combine protection services with a holistic approach that enables unaccompanied children and youth to find and cultivate their skills and talents.
  
  In addition, we care for refugee mothers and families with children. At our family center in central Athens, we provide access to psychosocial support, information, and workshops that will enable them to integrate better into society. We aim to contribute to a more efficient child protection system in Athens, by conducting independent research, bringing best practices, and partnering with experts around the world.

The shelter provides a temporary home to unaccompanied children, where the focus is to provide the best possible individual care to every child. Our approach is emphasized in our relationship with the children; we try to restore normality, guide them in critical life decisions, and enhance their curiosity and creativity through various activities.'
